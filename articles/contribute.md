## New Tool

Adding a new tool to a {nemo} child package consists of the following
steps:

1.  Data

Add subsets of data generated by the tool of interest under
`inst/extdata/<tool>`. Usually the top 10 rows (plus header) of a
straightforward TSV file are fine.
[DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc "Data Version Control") is
recommended for tracking the files in version control. See
[`vignette("devnotes")`](https://umccr.github.io/nemo/articles/devnotes.md)
for some DVC notes.

2.  Configs

Use the `inst/scripts/file_to_yaml.R` script to construct the *raw* YAML
config for the files of interest. The *tidy* YAML configs can be
prepared by copying the raw config and tidying the field names using
[snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case "Snake case wiki").
Copilot is *fairly* good at constructing this when having the raw and
tidy files open side by side. Pasting tables describing the fields from
the tool’s official documentation can also help Copilot with the field
description.

3.  Parsers

Create parsers under `R/<Tool>.R`. Use one of the other tool files as a
template.
